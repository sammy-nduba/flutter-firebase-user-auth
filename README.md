Sign Up and Register App with Firebase
This is a Flutter-based Sign Up and Register application using Firebase Authentication to handle user sign-ups, logins, and user management. This app allows users to create accounts, sign in, and handle authentication via Firebase.

Features
Sign Up: Users can create a new account with their email and password.
Login: Users can sign in with their registered email and password.
Firebase Authentication: All authentication handled through Firebase Auth.
Firebase Firestore: Store additional user data in Firebase Firestore after registration (optional).
Responsive UI: The app works well on both Android and iOS devices.
Prerequisites
Before running this app, ensure you have the following:

Flutter SDK: Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. Follow the installation guide: Flutter Installation.

Firebase Project: Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.

Set up Firebase Authentication and enable email/password sign-in.
Set up Firestore (optional if you want to store user data).
Add your Android and iOS app to Firebase.
FlutterFire Plugins: This project uses FlutterFire to integrate Firebase with Flutter. You'll need to add the necessary Firebase dependencies.

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
First, clone the project to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-firebase-signup-login.git
2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd flutter-firebase-signup-login
flutter pub get
3. Configure Firebase for your app
Android Configuration:
Go to the Firebase Console, select your project, and add an Android app.

Download the google-services.json file.

Place the google-services.json file in the android/app directory of your Flutter project.

Open android/build.gradle and add the following line under dependencies:

gradle
Copy code
classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
Open android/app/build.gradle and add this at the bottom of the file:

gradle
Copy code
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
iOS Configuration:
In the Firebase Console, add an iOS app and download the GoogleService-Info.plist file.
Open your project in Xcode, then drag and drop GoogleService-Info.plist into your project’s root folder in Xcode.
Ensure that your ios/Podfile is configured with the minimum required iOS version (e.g., platform :ios, '10.0').
4. Enable Firebase Authentication
In the Firebase Console, go to the Authentication section.
Under the Sign-in method tab, enable Email/Password authentication.
Run the App
1. Android/iOS:
Make sure you have an emulator or device connected, then run the following command:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
2. Web (optional):
You can also run the app in the web browser if you have the necessary Firebase configuration for web.

bash
Copy code
flutter run -d chrome
Firebase Authentication Flow
1. Sign Up
Users can register by entering their email and password.
On successful sign-up, Firebase creates a user and logs them in automatically.
2. Login
Users can log in with their registered email and password.
If the credentials are correct, they will be logged in and redirected to the home screen (or another screen).
3. Sign Out
The user can sign out, which will log them out of the app.
Firebase Firestore (Optional)
If you want to store additional user data (like profile information) after a successful sign-up, you can use Firebase Firestore. Here's how to configure Firestore:

In the Firebase Console, go to the Firestore section and set up a Firestore database.
Add user data to Firestore after the user registers, for example:
dart
Copy code
FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').add({
  'email': user.email,
  'createdAt': Timestamp.now(),
});
